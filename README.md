# pyTurbTraj
numerically computes stochastic lagrangian particle trajectories in JHU turbulence databases

To generate data, run particles_script.p for desired parameters.  
All of the functions that do the work called by this script are in tools.p.

Once saved, the data can be analyzed using the ipythoon notebooks analyze_history.ipynb and analyze_statistics.ipynb
